If you have access to NYT Annotated Corpus through LDC, please reach out to us via email and we'll share the temporal splits for truecasing with you. The sampling is done at random so resampling through the script can result in different sentences. However, as shown in the paper, truecing in the news is hardly impacted by temporal effects so we believe any random sample of sentences should work. We selected sentences that contain at least one capitalized word beside the first word of the sentence.
