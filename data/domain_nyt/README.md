This is the script to generate the temporal splits for domain classification used in the paper using the NYT Annotated Corpus downloaded from <a href="https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T19">https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T19</a>. The script extracts the opening paragraph of the first 40000 articles of a given year. Three consecutive years are combined together to generate a temporal split. Please update the path to the downloaded data in line 12 of the script, making sure not to modify the original directory structure. Also provide the year as a command line argument.
