The authors of the paper which introduced TTC dataset released the dataset as tweet ids at <a href="https://github.com/shrutirij/temporal-twitter-corpus">https://github.com/shrutirij/temporal-twitter-corpus</a>. Unfortunately several of those tweets are not available for download anymore. Please reach out to the TTC authors for access to the full datasets. The splits used in our temporal effects papers are slightly different then theirs as described in the paper. The development set is extracted from the training years instead of the 2019 test year and the original 2019 dev+test split serves as the full 2019 test split for us.
